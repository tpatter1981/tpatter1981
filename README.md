### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tiffani Patterson and I am freelance software engineer. My background originally was in HR and I kind of fell into coding by accident. I was watching a YouTube video and the creator mentioned that he was a software developer. I googled what that meant and ever since then I have been on this coding journey.
