### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tiffani Patterson. I have been on this coding adventure for about 2 years now. My background is in HR and I fell into coding by accident. I was watching a video on YouTube and the creator mentioned that he was a software developer. That peaked my interest and I googled computer programming. I have been traveling down the coding rabbit hole since then. It has been a fun ride so far and I look forward to whatever this new skill will bring in the future.
